        <h1>Hi, Nadinda here üëãüèº</h1>
        <h2>üßïüèΩ About me</h2>
        <p>
          Years ago, I've embarked on a career switch journey from finance to
          become a software developer.
          <br /><br />
          But, a series of health issues almost made me give up tech altogether.
          <br /><br />
          During my health recovery, I still managed to be connected to tech
          communities.
          <br /><br />
          Seeing a lot of people from different stage of their tech journey had
          reminded me why I started this career switch journey.
          <br /><br />
          I've always been interested in programming ever since I was a kid, but
          I did not pursue it because I thought as a girl I would not fit in the
          industry.
          <br /><br />
          Then at conferences and meetups, I started to meet a lot of amazing
          women who achieved great things in the tech industry.
          <br /><br />
          My career switch journey into software development has been full of
          setbacks. But after every setback I grow more resilient. I am not
          ready to quit my childhood dream. I aspire to be the role model I wish
          I had when I was a kid.
          <br /><br />
          I'm currently trying to re-enter the tech industry. I hope I can get
          accepted to the MYOB DevelopHer Scholarship and grow alongside other
          amazing emerging software developers!
          <br /><br />
